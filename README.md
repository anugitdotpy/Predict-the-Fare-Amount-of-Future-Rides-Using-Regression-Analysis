# Predict the Fare Amount of Future Rides Using Regression Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the fare amount for Uber rides using regression analysis. By leveraging historical ride data, a predictive model was developed to estimate fare amounts based on key features like trip distance, time of day, and location.

## Objective
- Build a regression model to predict ride fares accurately.
- Identify significant factors affecting ride fares.
- Implement data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Deploy and automate predictions.

## Dataset
- **Data Source:** Historical Uber ride data.
- **Key Features:**
  - Distance (in miles)
  - Time of day (peak/off-peak hours)
  - Day of the week (weekday/weekend)
  - Pickup and drop-off locations
  - Passenger count

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Development
3. Model Performance

## Feature Importance
- **Distance:** Primary factor affecting fare amount
- **Pickup & Drop-off Locations:** Geographic variations influence pricing
- **Time-Based Features:** Peak hours and weekends impact fare amounts
- **Passenger Count:** Affects fare types (e.g., shared rides vs. private rides)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the model:
   ```sh
   python predict_fare.py
   ```
4. Input new ride data for fare prediction.

## Use Cases
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust fares based on real-time conditions.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Optimize driver routes and earnings.
- **Customer Transparency:** Provide upfront fare estimates.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate real-time traffic and weather data.
- Deploy the model as an API.
- Enhance feature engineering for better accuracy.
